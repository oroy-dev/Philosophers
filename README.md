This project consists of solving the dining philosophers problem. I learned a lot about threads and mutexes and it was my first attempt at a multi-threaded program.

To run the program, please enter the following arguments: ./philo <NUMBER_OF_PHILOSOPHERS> <TIME_TO_DIE> <TIME_TO_EAT> <TIME_TO_SLEEP> <NUMBER_OF_TIMES_EACH_PHILOSOPHER_MUST_EAT>.
The last argument is optional.
